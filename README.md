### (2) File Organization Convention  
Each algorithm folder includes:  
- `README.md`: Concise theory overview, execution guide, and environment specs.  
- `*.ipynb`/`*.py`: Fully annotated code (Jupyter Notebooks or Python scripts).  
- `data/` (optional): Sample datasets (small CSVs included where applicable).  
- `docs/` (optional): In-depth references (formula derivations, scholarly links).  

## 3. Usage Guide  
### (1) Environment Setup  
We recommend Anaconda for dependency management. Core libraries:  
```python
# Core Scientific Computing
numpy>=1.21.0, pandas>=1.3.0, matplotlib>=3.4.0  
# Machine Learning
scikit-learn>=1.0.0  
# Optional Extensions
tensorflow>=2.0.0, seaborn>=0.11.0  
```  
Quick installation:  
```bash
conda create -n ml_env python=3.8  
conda activate ml_env  
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Create if needed
```

### (2) Executing Code  
Example using **02 Linear Regression**:  
1. Navigate: `cd "02 Linear Regression"`  
2. Run: `jupyter notebook Linear_Regression_Practice.ipynb`  
   or `python linear_regression.py`  
3. Modify **dataset paths/hyperparameters** (e.g., learning rate) per comments, then analyze outputs (loss curves, prediction visualizations).  

### (3) Learning Pathway  
1. **Step-by-Step Learning**: Begin with fundamentals (e.g., Linear Regression) to master loss functions and optimizers before advancing to tree models and ensemble methods.  
2. **Algorithm Comparison**: Benchmark different algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression vs. Decision Trees) on identical tasks using metrics like accuracy, recall, and training time.  
3. **Deepen Understanding**: Explore `docs/` for seminal papers and curated resources (e.g., *Elements of Statistical Learning*, Scikit-learn docs).  

## 4. Contribution & Feedback  
### (1) Improving the Repository  
To contribute optimizations (e.g., new algorithm variants, vectorized code) or case studies:  
1. Fork → Modify → Submit Pull Request.  
2. Propose enhancements via Issues (specify algorithm + improvement rationale).  

### (2) Reporting Issues  
Open an Issue for:  
- Execution errors (**include full traceback + environment details**).  
- Ambiguous documentation (e.g., unclear parameter explanations).  
- Missing datasets/dependencies (note affected folder).  

## 5. Target Audience  
- **Beginners**: Accelerate understanding through annotated code and structured guides.  
- **Engineers/Students**: Deepen knowledge via comparative implementations and theory-practice bridges.  
- **Educators**: Leverage as teaching aids or assignment templates.
