# Machine Learning Algorithm Engineer Code Collection

## 1、Project Introduction
This repository is a **comprehensive collection of learning materials and practical resources for machine learning algorithm engineers**. It covers a wide range of classic machine learning algorithms, including their code implementations, theoretical explanations, and practical case studies. The content spans from fundamental algorithms to advanced ensemble learning techniques, aiming to help learners deeply understand algorithmic logic and quickly apply them in real-world scenarios.

## 2、Content Structure
### （1）Algorithm Module Classification
The repository is organized into folders by algorithm type. Each folder focuses on a specific category of algorithms and includes **code implementations, theoretical documentation, and test datasets** (where applicable). The following table provides an overview:

| Folder Name       | Algorithm Type                | Core Content Summary                     |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 02 Linear Regression | Supervised Learning - Regression | Linear model-based implementations covering single/multiple linear regression, loss function derivation, and gradient descent optimization. |
| 03 Logistic Regression | Supervised Learning - Classification | Solves binary/multiclass classification problems with Sigmoid function, logarithmic loss, and regularization (L1/L2) practices. |
| 04 Decision Trees    | Supervised Learning - Tree Models | Covers ID3, C4.5, CART algorithms with feature selection (information gain, GINI index) and pruning strategies. |
| 05 Naive Bayes      | Supervised Learning - Probabilistic Classification | Based on Bayes' theorem and feature independence assumptions, includes text classification (bag-of-words model) examples. |
| 06 Support Vector Machines | Supervised Learning - Classification/Regression | Explains maximum margin classification, kernel functions (linear, RBF, etc.), soft margin, and multiclass implementations. |
| 07 Clustering        | Unsupervised Learning         | Includes K-Means, hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN, etc., with clustering evaluation metrics and application scenarios. |
| 08 Principal Component Analysis | Unsupervised Learning - Dimensionality Reduction | Implements PCA algorithm with variance maximization, feature reconstruction, and high-dimensional data visualization. |
| 09 Ensemble Learning | Algorithm Fusion (Boosting/Bagging) | Covers Bagging (Random Forest), Boosting (AdaBoost, GBDT), Stacking, and other frameworks. |
| 10 Case Studies      | Comprehensive Practice        | Complete projects integrating multiple algorithms, such as credit risk assessment, simplified image classification, and customer segmentation. |

### （2）File Organization Convention
Each algorithm folder typically contains:
- `README.md`: Quick overview of algorithm theory, code execution instructions, and environment dependencies.
- `*.ipynb`/`*.py`: Code implementations (Jupyter Notebook/Python scripts with detailed comments).
- `data/` (optional): Test datasets (e.g., CSV format; small datasets are directly included).
- `docs/` (optional): Theoretical documentation (formula derivations, reference links).

## 3、Usage Guide
### （1）Environment Setup
We recommend managing the environment with Anaconda. Core dependencies include:# Basic Packages
numpy>=1.21.0 pandas>=1.3.0 matplotlib>=3.4.0
# Machine Learning Libraries
scikit-learn>=1.0.0
# (Optional) Deep Learning/Visualization
tensorflow>=2.0.0 seaborn>=0.11.0To install quickly:conda create -n ml_env python=3.8
conda activate ml_env
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Create this file first if needed
### （2）Running the Code
Taking **02 Linear Regression** as an example:
1. Navigate to the folder: `cd 02 Linear Regression`
2. Run the notebook: `jupyter notebook Linear_Regression_Practice.ipynb`
   or execute the script directly: `python linear_regression.py`
3. Adjust **dataset paths and hyperparameters** (e.g., learning rate, iterations) according to code comments, then observe the output (loss function changes, model prediction visualizations).

### （3）Learning Recommendations
1. **Progressive Learning**: Start with foundational algorithms like `02 Linear Regression` to understand loss functions and optimizers before moving on to tree-based models and ensemble learning.
2. **Comparative Practice**: Apply different algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression vs. Decision Trees) to the same problem and compare metrics (accuracy, recall, training time).
3. **Extended Reading**: Each algorithm folder's `docs/` section includes classic papers and recommended resources (e.g., Scikit-learn documentation, relevant chapters from *The Elements of Statistical Learning*) for deeper theoretical understanding.

## 4、Contribution and Feedback
